    <h1>Review of day 1</h1>
      <p> Today we learned how to navigate the terminal,
      shorcut actions around the directory,
      and maintain a clean and organized file system.
      </p>
      <p> We also learned how to update our very own github repositories.
      we pushed and pulled info.. and this is my attempt to do it on my own.
